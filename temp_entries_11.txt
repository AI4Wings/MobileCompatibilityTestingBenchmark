- Info: "Users can run Exposure Notifications apps without needing to turn on the device location setting."
- Describe: "Android 11 allows users to run Exposure Notifications apps without enabling device location settings. This is a special exception for the Exposure Notifications System only, as it's designed to prevent location inference through Bluetooth scanning.\n\nAll other apps still require device location settings to be enabled for Bluetooth scanning."

- Name: "App usage stats in credential encrypted storage"
- Info: "Android 11 stores each user's app usage stats in credential encrypted storage for better protection."
- Describe: "Android 11 enhances security by storing app usage stats in credential encrypted storage. Apps can only access this data after the user unlocks their device (isUserUnlocked() returns true). This occurs after device unlock or user account switch.\n\nApps using UsageStatsManager must verify the user has unlocked their device before calling methods, as they will now return null or empty values otherwise."
