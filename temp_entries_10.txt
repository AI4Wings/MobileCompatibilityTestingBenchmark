# System Changes

1. Non-SDK Interface Restrictions
- Category: "System"
- Type: "Change (all apps)"
- Name: "Updated non-SDK interface restrictions"
- Info: "Android 10 includes updated lists of restricted non-SDK interfaces based on collaboration with Android developers and internal testing."
- Describe: "To help ensure app stability and compatibility, Android 10 continues restricting which non-SDK interfaces apps can use. The platform provides public alternatives before restricting non-SDK interfaces.\n\nApps should test for non-SDK interface usage and plan migration to SDK alternatives."
- API_List: "[]"

2. Gesture Navigation
- Category: "System"
- Type: "Change (all apps)"
- Name: "System-wide gesture navigation"
- Info: "Users can enable gesture navigation across the device, affecting all apps regardless of target API level."
- Describe: "Beginning with Android 10, users can enable system-wide gesture navigation. This affects all apps, including those not targeting API level 29. For example, edge swipes are interpreted as Back navigation unless specifically overridden.\n\nApps should extend content edge-to-edge and handle conflicting gestures appropriately."
- API_List: "[]"
- Source: "https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-all#gesture-nav"

3. Shared Objects Restrictions
- Category: "NDK"
- Type: "Change (all apps)"
- Name: "Shared objects cannot contain text relocations"
- Info: "SELinux enforces text relocation restrictions on shared objects for apps targeting Android 10 or higher."
- Describe: "Android 6.0 disallowed use of text relocations in shared objects. In Android 10, SELinux enforces this restriction for apps targeting API level 29 or higher. Code must be loaded as-is and cannot be modified.\n\nThis change improves app load times and security."

- Type: "Change (all apps)"
- Name: "System binaries/libraries mapped to execute-only memory"
- Info: "Executable segments of system binaries and libraries are mapped into memory execute-only as a hardening technique."
- Describe: "Starting in Android 10, executable segments of system binaries and libraries are mapped into memory execute-only (non-readable) to protect against code-reuse attacks. Read operations on execute-only memory segments result in SIGSEGV signals.\n\nApps can use mprotect() to temporarily mark segments as read+execute for debugging purposes."
