- Info: "Android 15 introduces Low Light Boost, an auto-exposure mode available to both Camera 2 and the night mode camera extension."
- Describe: "Android 15 introduces Low Light Boost, an auto-exposure mode available to both Camera 2 and the night mode camera extension. Low Light Boost adjusts the exposure of the Preview stream in low-light conditions.\n\nThis is different from how the night mode camera extension creates still images, because night mode combines a burst of photos to create a single, enhanced image. While night mode works very well for creating a still image, it can't create a continuous stream of frames, but Low Light Boost can.\n\nCapabilities enabled:\n- Providing an enhanced image preview for better low-light framing\n- Scanning QR codes in low light\n- Recording brightened video from Preview stream"
